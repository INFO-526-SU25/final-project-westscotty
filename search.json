    "text": "Introduction\nExploratory analysis was conducted of seismic activity at Mount Vesuvius, Italy, utilizing the Mount Vesuvius Dataset from Tidy Tuesday (May 13, 2025). The dataset, spanning the last two decades, includes key variables such as latitude, longitude, depth_km, and duration_magnitude_md, which record the geographic coordinates, depth, and magnitude of seismic events. The project aims to uncover underlying relationships between these variables through time series and static analyses, addressing two primary research questions: (1) How have the frequency and depth of seismic events at Mount Vesuvius changed over time? and (2) How does the depth of seismic events relate to their magnitude, and are deeper events more powerful?"

    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\n\nQuestion 1: How have the frequency and depth of seismic events at Mount Vesuvius changed over time?\nSee Tab: Question 1\nThe analysis examines temporal changes in the frequency and depth of seismic events by first wrangling the time column of the Mount Vesuvius Dataset to convert it into a usable date format, replacing “T” with a space and removing “Z”, then extracting year and month for aggregation. Data is filtered to remove missing duration_magnitude_md and depth_km values, and aggregated by year and month to calculate mean values, enabling a more fluid trend analysis. This approach employs a variety of visualizations (quite numerous) including scatter plots with geom_jitter and geom_smooth, histograms with geom_histogram, and error plots with geom_linerange and geom_errorbar—to assess frequency and depth changes over time. This multi-method strategy is supported by tidyverse and ggplot2 aiding in learning both overall and detailed distribution-level trends across the two-decade dataset.\nThe code is well-structured and has a good work-flow. Data wrangling with mutate and str_replace_all transforms the time column into a POSIXct date, while group_by and summarise aggregate the means by year and month. Visualization code, such as geom_jitter with geom_smooth and faceted geom_histogram, is clearly formatted with labeled axes and titles.\nThe visualizations are appropriate and clearly labeled. Scatter plots (plot_1, plot_2) show mean duration_magnitude_md and mean_depth_km by year with geom_jitter and a LOESS geom_smooth, using custom axes. Monthly plots (plot_3, plot_4) extend this to year-month with scale_x_date. Histograms (plot_5, plot_6) facet depth_km and duration_magnitude_md by year. Error plots (plot_9, plot_10) use geom_linerange and geom_errorbar to display ranges for tracking the temporal changes.\nThe analysis reveals that average depth and duration magnitude have stabilized over time, with a noticeable increase in event frequency since 2013, as indicated by histogram facets showing consistent depth distributions and low magnitude values (typically below 3). The LOESS smooths suggest a leveling off of trends, while error plots highlight variability, with deeper events becoming less frequent but still present. The rise in recorded events since 2016 aligns with improved data collection standard. This project aimed to analyze the data at a high level looking into the years overall, merging the more granular monthly data into an aggregate statistic.\n\n\nQuestion 2: How does the depth of seismic events relate to their magnitude? Are deeper events more powerful?\nSee Tab: Question 2\nThe analysis investigates the relationship between seismic event depth and magnitude by cleaning the dataset to remove missing values in latitude, longitude, depth_km, and duration_magnitude_md. A new variable, depth_boundary_0.5km, is created to bin depths into 0.5 km intervals, with an additional depth_boundary_1km for broader categorization, enabling detailed spatial and statistical exploration. Point sizes are rescaled using rescale to reflect depth variations, and visualizations are developed in stages: an initial scatter plot maps magnitude and depth, a histogram facets magnitude by depth bins, a static plot adds elevation contours, and an animated plot transitions through depth layers using gganimate. This approach,uses a variety of methods to discoverer trends in a spatial context.\nThe code is well-organized and legible (though it could use commentary), utilizing dplyr for data manipulations including drop_na, mutate, filter, arrange. The case_when function creates depth bins with precise level definitions, and rescale adjusts point sizes and magnitudes. Elevation data is fetched with elevatr and processed into a dataframe, while gganimate configures transitions for the animated plot.\nThe visualizations are appropriate and labeled consistently. The initial scatter plot uses a Viridis “magma” color scale for duration_magnitude_md and alpha transparency for depth_abs, with axes limited to [14.34, 14.48] longitude and [40.78, 40.88] latitude. The histogram employs red fill and white outlines, faceted by depth_boundary_0.5km. The static plot integrates metR::geom_contour_fill with a gray-scale elevation discrete gradient color-bar and points sized by depth_rescaled, while the animated plot transitions through depth bins, using additional shadow effects. Legends are horizontally placed in all figures with titles and captions, adding consistency.\nDiving into question 2 and the associated visualizations reveals that seismic activity is frequent at shallower depths (&lt; 1 km), with varied magnitudes, while deeper events (&gt; 5 km) are less frequent but exhibit higher average magnitudes, suggesting deeper events may be more powerful on average. The histogram confirms a skewed distribution toward lower magnitudes across all depths, and the static plot, visually improved by elevation contours, indicates a 1.2 km elevation gain toward the center, embedding depth relative to sea level. However, challenges with gganimate include theme preservation and contour accuracy highlight limitations."
