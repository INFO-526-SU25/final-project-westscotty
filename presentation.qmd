## The Data

-   Mount Vesuvius Dataset from Tidy Tuesday (May 13, 2025)

-   The data contains records of seismic activity at or near Mt. Vesuvius, Italy over the last decade or so

-   Source: <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-05-13/readme.md>

## The Goal

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Interpret the underlying relationships between variables of interest including time series and static analysis of the seismic data recorded at the famous Mt. Vesuvius.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## Question 1

**How have the frequency and depth of seismic events at Mount Vesuvius changed over time?**

## Question 2

**How does the depth of seismic events relate to their magnitude? Are deeper events more powerful?**

-   \<Add stuff here\>

## Approach

-   The first step was to remove bad (or missing) data by dropping rows with NA in `latitude`, `longitude`, `depth_km`, and `duration_magnitude_md`
-   The first step was to down-sample the raw depth data into levels only depth boundaries spanning 0.5 km bands, creating a new variable titled `depth_boundary_0.5km`, plotting in ascending depth order meaning that deeper values will appear first
-   A size re-scaling for points was created from this new depth layer variable

## Histogram

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Plotting a histogram of the `duration_magnitude_md` values for each points, faceted by the `depth_boundary_0.5km` variable allows for verification that each depth layer has valid data

-   The statistical distributions are also shown, indicating that shallower depths
