-   Mount Vesuvius Dataset from Tidy Tuesday (May 13, 2025)
-   The data contains records of seismic activity at or near Mt. Vesuvius, Italy over the last 2 decades
-   The goal is to interpret the underlying relationships between variables of interest including time series and static analyses of the seismic data recorded at the famous Mt. Vesuvius.

## Exploratory Question 1 {style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 0.75"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.25"}
**How have the frequency and depth of seismic events at Mount Vesuvius changed over time?**

-   This section of the presentation reviews the behaviors of the seismic events' over time
-   The following plots are used to analyze the `duration_magnitude_md` and the `depth_md` of the seismic events
    -   Line plots
    -   Histograms
    -   Error plots

## Analysis {style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 0.75"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.25"}
-   The Depth and the Duration Magnitude of the seismic events are became smaller

-   More Events have been recorded since 2016

-   The Duration Magnitude remains low (below 3)
:::

## Challenges Faced {style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 0.75"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.25"}
-   How to interpret and down-sample the data.

    -   Since the data has such a high variation it was not evident to notice a pattern unless the data was down-sampled.

-   Choosing the plots that best illustrate behavior of the data.

    -   After down-sampling the data, it was challenging to decide on what type of plot would illustrate the behavior of the data.

-   Creating bins and counting the frequency if the events

-   Overlaying the mountain over the `depth_md` seismic events, the latitude and longitude needed to be translated to time to add within the plots of `depth_md`
:::

## Exploratory Question 2 {style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 0.75"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.25"}
**How does the depth of seismic events relate to their magnitude? Are deeper events more powerful?**

-   Exploring this question requires extraction of hidden data to synthesize new variable, aiding in exploring the seismic activity at Mt. Vesuvius
-   Extracting data into effective visualizations involved utilizing `ggplot`, `geom_point`, `geom_contour_fill`, `geom_hist`, and integrating with `gganimate`
-   These visuals provide a viewing window into the trends connecting seismic event magnitudes with depth

Next the data was plotted as histograms of the `duration_magnitude_md`, but faceted by the newer `depth_boundary_0.5km` variable, showing the groupings of points clearer, as well as their distributions across the magnitude scale

After learning from the histogram, the initial plot was updated to plot the points with varying sizes based on `depth_boundary_0.5km`, with contour lines of the elevation in the same region, an accompanying animated plot followed it

## Analysis {style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 0.75"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.25"}
-   Seismic activity occurs quite frequently, and looking at the histogram alone, it is clear that more events occur at the shallower depths
-   Though there are data points that suggest powerful magnitude events can occur at shallow depths, the static plot, animated plot, and histogram agree that more powerful events occur at deeper depths on average, but are much less frequent as compared to the activity closer to the surface
-   It should be noted that with the elevation contour lines that the deeper events are truly much deeper than the points localized in the center of Mt. Vesuvius. There is about a 1.2 km elevation gain from the outer region of the landmark compared to the center.
:::

## Challenges Faced {style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 0.75"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.25"}
-   Manipulating the `depth_km` field was challenging due to the amount of data in each bin. It was essential that at least one data point was in each division, but showing the fewer bins than what was used proved to not be effective in showing the trends
-   `gganimate` does not preserve all the theme options that were established and called out, leading to a plot that closely resembles it's static counterpart, but not equivalent in the features desired. Contour lines seemed to not work right, now drawing the layers as intended.
-   Formatting legends also proved to be a labor of love, as there are many ways to show them, but keeping consistency among the plots created a rigorous amount of testing with many options added to ensure they appeared 'uniform'
:::

## Final Remarks {style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 0.75"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em; line-height: 1.25"}
- Mt. Vesuvius is a historical landmark and over the last decade the seismic activity has been succesfully recorded aiding in understanding it's behaviors, ultimately lending itself to being better prepared for any future seismic events
- Utilizing `R` and `ggplot` to visualize and explore data fosters more creative thinkers in the world as well as enabling greater understanding of topics worth exploring
