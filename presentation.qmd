## The Data

-   Mount Vesuvius Dataset from Tidy Tuesday (May 13, 2025)

-   The data contains records of seismic activity

    -   At or near Mt. Vesuvius, Italy

    -   Over the last decade or so

-   Source:

    -   [Tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-05-13/readme.md){.uri}

## The Goal

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Interpret the underlying relationships between variables of interest of the seismic data recorded at the famous Mt. Vesuvius.

-   Time series

-   Static analysis

-   Histograms
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## Question 1

**How have the frequency and depth of seismic events at Mount Vesuvius changed over time?**

-   This section of the presentation reviews the seismic events' behavior over time
-   The following plots are used to analyze the Duration Magnitude and the Depth of the seismic events
    -   Line plots
    -   Histograms
    -   Error plots

## Approach

1.  Any NaN were removed for the Duration Magnitude and the Depth

2.  The data was smoothed out by calculating the averages per year & month

3.  The time was wrangled to remove undesired characters

## Plots

## Analysis

Here are some observations:

-   The Depth and the Duration Magnitude of the seismic events are became smaller

-   More Events have been recorded since 2016

-   The Duration Magnitude remains low (below 3)

## Challenges Faced

The challenges were around how to interpret and plot the data with so high deviation. The data is also very random, as if these behaviors follow a binomial distribution.

## Question 2

**How does the depth of seismic events relate to their magnitude? Are deeper events more powerful?**

-   \<Add stuff here\>

## Approach

-   The first step was to remove bad (or missing) data by dropping rows with NA in `latitude`, `longitude`, `depth_km`, and `duration_magnitude_md`
-   The first step was to down-sample the raw depth data into levels only depth boundaries spanning 0.5 km bands, creating a new variable titled `depth_boundary_0.5km`, plotting in ascending depth order meaning that deeper values will appear first
-   A size re-scaling for points was created from this new depth layer variable
